**# FLAPPY WIZARD**
**## The Game**
this is a game inspired by flappy bird, wich is called Flappy Wizard.
you fly by clicking left click and your objective in this game is to fly with the Wizard Bird and try to avoid hitting the pipes.
the background of the game was inspired by the theme MAGIC.
**## How it was made**
I saw a tutorial by a Youtube channel called : Coding with Russ
wich helped me with making the game from scratch because I didn't know anything in godot.
**## Supported platforms**
It works on Monitors with a resulotion of 1920 * 1080 if tried on any other resulotion it may contain a lot of bugs.
**## Why was it made**
I made the game because I joined an event in HackClub wich is called : Seige and the objective of that event is to make a project every week for 9 weeks and every project must contain at least 10 hours of working. this project was made in 10 hours+
**# Thanks for HackClub that it made me take the first step on learning godot.**
